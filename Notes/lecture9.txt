We will need to create a binary tree, though it is not logically one, it physically is.

oops
 |
cops - fops - hops - mops
 |      |      |      |
 |      |      |     mope - moss - mows
 |      |     haps - hips - hoes
 |     fabs - foes - fogs
cobs - cods - cogs - coos

oops is the parent, cops is the FIRST child of oops, and cobs is the first child of cops.

The - lines are the siblings of the children. So fobs, hops, and mops don't know who their parents
are, however, their first? Favorite? Sibling do know who their parents are. 

struct TreeNode{
	std::string word;
	std::shared_ptr<Node> firstChild; // Left Branch
	std::shared_ptr<Node> nextSibling; //Right Branch

}

Must be done in a pre-order build.

... talk to Vicki or the friends?

Again, to print it just depends on where you put your print statement.

Pre-Order:
	Print
	Left
	Right

In-Order:
	Left
	Print
	Right

Post-Order
	Left
	Right
	Print
