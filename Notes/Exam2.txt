Hash Tables: Hash Functions, Double Hash, Cuckoo Hash. Probling: Liner Quadratic.
Priorit Queues: Binary Heap, Leftest Heap, Skew Heap, Binomial Queue.
Sorting: Insert, Shell, Heap, Merge, Quick.

Hash

Mimimizing colisions
Uses personalized incrementor key+1%tableSize+1 = output1
Hash key%tableSize = output 2;

mHash -> Hash(output 1,Output 2) = Output 3

Cuckoo Hashing

You have two hash tables, not sure how it really works

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Queues

Binary Heap, basically your parent has higher priority than you with a lower number. Always fill in from left to right. 

Leftest heap, have really fast insert times because it always tries to keep itself balance to the left. Need to study up on this again, ;_; merging and inserting are legit the same thing bruv. Ya undastand fam?
